  "description": "Voice Task Manager is a Vapi-powered voice assistant that lets busy professionals run their entire day without touching a screen. Call the agent, speak naturally—“Remind me to send the invoice tomorrow at 3 p.m.” or “What’s on my calendar today?”—and it instantly creates tasks, schedules events, summarizes unread email, and warns about conflicts. A FastAPI backend orchestrates real-time speech streaming from Vapi, a GPT-4o–based intent engine, and live integrations with Google Calendar and Gmail. Everything happens in under a second, so users can add items, hear personalized briefings, or mark tasks complete while commuting, cooking, or walking between meetings.",
