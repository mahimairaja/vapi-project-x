# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Quality Improvements and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add polite re-prompting, barge-in support, and comprehensive error handling
# Details:
Implement barge-in support to allow users to interrupt TTS. Create polite re-prompting flows for misunderstood commands. Add comprehensive error handling for all API integrations. Implement exponential back-off for rate limits. Create fallback mechanisms for LLM failures. Add detailed logging for troubleshooting. Implement OWASP top-10 security review. Create graceful degradation paths for service outages.

# Test Strategy:
Test barge-in functionality during TTS playback. Verify error handling with simulated API failures. Test rate limit handling with rapid requests. Conduct security review against OWASP guidelines.
