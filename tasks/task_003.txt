# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Vapi Webhook Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the /vapi/webhook endpoint to handle incoming Vapi voice calls and manage session state
# Details:
Implement the /vapi/webhook endpoint to receive Vapi voice call events. Set up ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-to-Speech) streaming with Vapi. Create session state management to maintain context during calls. Implement basic greeting and farewell flows. Handle call connection, disconnection, and error states. Ensure sub-400ms turn latency as specified in the PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test webhook with simulated Vapi requests. Verify session state persistence across multiple requests. Measure response latency to ensure it meets the sub-400ms requirement.
