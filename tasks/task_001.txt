# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and FastAPI Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with FastAPI framework, SQLModel, and basic project structure
# Details:
Create a new repository with proper .gitignore. Set up FastAPI with SQLModel for ORM. Configure project structure with routes, models, services, and utils directories. Install required dependencies (fastapi, sqlmodel, uvicorn, python-dotenv). Create a basic config module for environment variables. Set up a simple health check endpoint to verify the API is running.

# Test Strategy:
Verify FastAPI server starts successfully. Test health check endpoint returns 200 OK. Ensure SQLModel connects to SQLite database.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Repository and Install Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new GitHub repository with proper structure and install all required dependencies
### Details:
1. Create a new GitHub repository
2. Initialize with a Python-specific .gitignore file
3. Create a requirements.txt file with the following dependencies: fastapi, sqlmodel, uvicorn, python-dotenv
4. Create a README.md with project description
5. Set up a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
6. Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Create a basic project structure with directories: app/, tests/
8. Inside app/ create subdirectories: routes/, models/, services/, utils/
9. Test by ensuring all packages install correctly and the repository structure is properly set up

## 2. Configure Environment and Project Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up configuration module for environment variables and basic project settings
### Details:
1. Create a .env file in the root directory with basic configuration variables (e.g., DATABASE_URL, API_ENV=development)
2. Create a .env.example file as a template
3. In app/utils/ create config.py module that uses python-dotenv to load environment variables
4. Implement configuration class with settings for different environments (dev, test, prod)
5. Create main.py in the root app/ directory that initializes the FastAPI application
6. Configure CORS, middleware, and other basic FastAPI settings in main.py
7. Test the configuration by printing environment variables and ensuring they load correctly
8. Add documentation in the code explaining the configuration approach

## 3. Implement Health Check Endpoint and Basic API Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Set up the basic API structure with a health check endpoint to verify the API is running correctly
### Details:
1. In app/routes/ create health.py with a simple health check endpoint that returns status 200 and a JSON response
2. Create app/routes/__init__.py to make the directory a proper package
3. In app/main.py, import and include the health check router
4. Set up a basic error handling middleware
5. Create a simple database connection setup in app/models/base.py using SQLModel
6. Implement a basic schema for API responses in app/models/schemas.py
7. Test the API by running it with uvicorn: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
8. Verify the health check endpoint works by accessing it at http://localhost:8000/health
9. Document the API structure and endpoints in the README.md
